# FileStructures
<p>The projects focus on read/write binary files and on the implementation of B-Trees.</p> 
<p>Here are the features descriptions:</p>
  1.  Data storage from .csv to .bin file
  2.  Full data recovery
  3.  Data recovery based on search criteria
  4.  Data recovery based on RRN
  5.  Logic Removal - Static Approach
  6.  Record insertion - Static Approach
  7.  Field update of a record - RRN
  8.  Creation of index file from data records (B-Tree)
  9.  Record retrieval w Search criteria (B-Tree)
  10. Inserting records - Static Approach + Inserting index files (B-Tree)
  
<p> The functions were organized based on the partial submissions during the semester, but basically:</p>

- `Parte1.c`
       Functions to read and parse .csv and write in stdout and .bin.
- `Parte2.c`
       Functions to analyze search criteria, recovery and add new records to .bin file.
- `Parte3.c`
       Functions related to B-Tree implementation.
